# Overview

* This repo contains the prework I'm on track to complete for 2nd course that I applied to on CodePath: IOS Development.
* This will involve a "Hello World" project, where I'll learn from Apple's documentation and CodePath resources


# Resources
  * [Apple Official Documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/)
  * [CodePath's "Understanding Swift"](https://guides.codepath.com/ios/Understanding-Swift)
